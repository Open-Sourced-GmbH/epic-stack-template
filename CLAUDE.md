## Working in this repo

- [Code conventions](docs/agents/code-conventions.md) - path aliases, file
  naming, SSR, design tokens
- [Git workflow](docs/agents/git-workflow.md) - conventional commits, develop →
  staging → main promote flow, release-please
- [Issue conventions](docs/agents/linear-issues.md) - labels, priorities, PRDs
- [Skills](docs/agents/skills-pipeline.md) - process skills (PRD → grill →
  issues → implement → PR) and the `epic-*` domain skills
- [Styleguide & Claude Design](docs/agents/styleguide.md) - the design-system
  source of truth and the `/to-design` → `/to-grounded-design` design lane

## Agent skills

Config the engineering skills (`to-issues`, `to-prd`, `triage`, `tdd`,
`grill-with-docs`, `to-design`, `to-grounded-design`, …) read to learn this
repo's conventions. Re-run `/setup-matt-pocock-skills` to regenerate these (see
[skills-pipeline.md](docs/agents/skills-pipeline.md)).

The design lane (`to-design` → [Claude Design](https://claude.ai/design) →
`to-grounded-design`) grounds feature design in the living `/styleguide` route;
see [styleguide.md](docs/agents/styleguide.md).

### Issue tracker

Issues and PRDs live in **Linear** (`mcp__linear__*` tools, not `gh`). See
[`docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`](docs/agents/issue-tracker.md).

### Triage labels

Canonical triage roles map to this repo's Linear statuses/labels. See
[`docs/agents/triage-labels.md`](docs/agents/triage-labels.md).

### Domain docs

Single-context, flat: domain notes plus `docs/decisions/` ADRs. See
[`docs/agents/domain.md`](docs/agents/domain.md).
